## Bank Marketing (with social/economic context)

The binary classification goal is to predict if the client will subscribe a bank term deposit (variable y).


### Steps:

1. Importing Libraries
2. Exploratory Data Analysis
3. Missing Value Treatment
4. Split Data Into Train and Test
5. Model Building with hyperparameter tuning and Model Evaluation:<br>
    i. Logistic Regression <br>
    ii. Random Forest Classifier <br>
    iii. Gradient Boosting <br>


### Two notebook files:
 1.  In one notebook I did not take duration as input to the models.
 2.  In another notebook I did take duration as input to the models. [ So that we can use these models once we have contacted a client ]
